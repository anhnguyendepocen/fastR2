\title{Goose permits}
\format{A data frame with 11 rows and 5 columns.  
Each row corresponds to a bid (in US dollars)
offered for a goose permit.  The colums \code{keep} and \code{sell} indicate 
how many hunters offered that bid kept or sold their permit, respectively.
\code{n} is the sum of \code{keep} and \code{sell} and \code{prop_sell}
is the proportion that sold.}
\description{
In a 1979 study by Bishop and Heberlein, 237 hunters were each offered one of 
11 cash amounts (bids) ranging from $1 to $200 in return for their hunting permits.
The data records how many hunters offered each bid kept or sold their permit.
